### Configure the Bot:
   - Ensure you forked the repo first so that you be able to edit it on your forked repo.

   - Navigate to it and Add your bot token, bot user ID(id) and other settings:
     ```
     "ownerId": bot owner user id
     ```
     ```
     "botToken": "bot token "

  - Follow other specific platform instructions to deploy your bot because as for me I do use Heroku.

## Usage

To interact with the bot, users can send commands and messages. The bot will respond based on its features and functionality. Here are some examples:

- `/menu / /start` - Displays a list of available commands and their descriptions.
- `And Many Other Cmds` - Use the bot to discover by yourself.
